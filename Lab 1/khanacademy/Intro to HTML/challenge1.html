    <h1>R U Mine?</h1>
    <p>I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
       And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
       And I can't help myself
All I wanna ever say is, "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (Are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (Or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (Are you mine? Mine?)</p>
